0. I just ran the executable and it gave me the secret directly.
1. I ran the executable first. Since it asked me what random number it had generated, I ran the exectuable with ltrace to trace srand. Then I converted the return value of the srand function to decimal which I gave as input to the program. It returned back the secret.
2. I ran the executable again. This time, I had to find the final characters at the end of the URL for the secret. I ran it with ltrace and saw the use of strcat which included the secret as the second string.
3. I first ran the executable. I saw that it required me to create a file first. I ran it with strace and it showed me that the program was making the stat system call on "iamspecial" that was returning -1. So I created the file first and ran the program again. This time, it was asking for a permission on the file. I ran it with strace again. It was calling access with X_OK. So I gave the file the execute permission using chmod. I ran the executable again. This time, it printed out the secret.
